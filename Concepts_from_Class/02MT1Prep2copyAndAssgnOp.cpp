/*
What is a copy constructor?
 A copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object using
 another object of the same class. A copy constructor has the following general
 function prototype:
*/

ClassName (const ClassName &old_obj);

/* example 1: */

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point {
private:
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(int x1, int y1) { x = x1; y = y1; }

    // Copy constructor
    Point(const Point &p2) {x = p2.x; y = p2.y; }

    int getX()            {  return x; }
    int getY()            {  return y; }
};

int main() {
    Point p1(10, 15); // Normal constructor is called here
    Point p2 = p1; // Copy constructor is called here

    // Let us access values assigned by constructors
    cout << "p1.x = " << p1.getX() << ", p1.y = " << p1.getY();
    cout << "\np2.x = " << p2.getX() << ", p2.y = " << p2.getY();

    return 0;
}

/*
p1.x = 10, p1.y = 15
p2.x = 10, p2.y = 15
*/

/*
Copy Constructor may be called in following cases:
1. When an object of the class is returned by value.
2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument.
3. When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class.
4. When compiler generates a temporary object.

When is user defined copy constructor needed?

If we donâ€™t define our own copy constructor, the C++ compiler creates a default
    -copy constructor for each class which does a member wise copy between
    objects.

    -The compiler created copy constructor works fine in general. We need to
    define our own copy constructor only if an object has pointers or any run
    time allocation of resource like file handle, a network connection..etc.

   Default constructor does only shallow copy.

    -Deep copy is possible only with user defined copy constructor.
        -In user defined copy constructor, we make sure that pointers
        (or references) of copied object point to new memory locations.

    ---Copy constructor vs Assignment Operator---
        Which of the following two statements call copy constructor and which
        one calls assignment operator?

        MyClass t1, t2;
        MyClass t3 = t1;  // ----> calls copy constrictor
        t2 = t1;          // -----> calls assignment operator

        Copy constructor is called when a new object is created from an
        existing object, as a copy of the existing object.
        Assignment operator is called when an already initialized object is
        assigned a new value from another existing object.


        Write an example class where copy constructor is needed?
        Following is a complete C++ program to demonstrate use of Copy constructor. In the following String class, we must write copy constructor.
